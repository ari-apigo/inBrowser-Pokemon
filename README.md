# PokéPortal
## In-Browser Pokémon

This site was inspired by the Pokémon games by Nintendo and allows the user to experience
choosing their first Pokémon.

This project was my first attempt at using JavaScript in web design. This was also a creative
assignment for the web programming course at the University of Washington.
